## get_address_details

> crate::models::GetAddressDetailsR get_address_details(blockchain, network, address, context)
Get Address Details

Through this endpoint the customer can receive basic information about a given address based on confirmed/synced blocks only. In the case where there are any incoming or outgoing **unconfirmed** transactions for the specific address, they **will not** be counted or calculated here.

### Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Required | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**blockchain** | **String** | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc. | [required] |
**network** | **String** | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\", \"rinkeby\" are test networks. | [required] |
**address** | **String** | Represents the public address, which is a compressed and shortened form of a public key. | [required] |
**context** | Option<**String**> | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user. |  |

### Return type
