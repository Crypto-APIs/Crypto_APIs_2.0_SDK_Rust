## get_address_details_from_callback

> crate::models::GetAddressDetailsFromCallbackR get_address_details_from_callback(blockchain, network, address, context)
Get Address Details From Callback

This endpoint creates a shortcut to obtain information from Blockchain data by going through Blockchain Events and a specific Event Subscription. It provides data for a specific address from the Event it takes part in only if the address already exists in the blockchain events subscriptions. It applies only for Events related to that customer.

### Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Required | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**blockchain** | **String** | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc. | [required] |
**network** | **String** | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\" are test networks. | [required] |
**address** | **String** | Represents the public address, which is a compressed and shortened form of a public key. | [required] |
**context** | Option<**String**> | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user. |  |

### Return type

## get_block_details_by_block_hash_from_callback

> crate::models::GetBlockDetailsByBlockHashFromCallbackR get_block_details_by_block_hash_from_callback(blockchain, network, block_hash, context)
Get Block Details By Block Hash From Callback

This endpoint creates a shortcut to obtain information from Blockchain data by going through Blockchain Events and a specific Event Subscription. It provides data for a specific block by providing the `blockHash` attribute from the Event it takes part in and after making check that the customer in question does have a subscription for this block. It applies only for Events related to that user.

### Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Required | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**blockchain** | **String** | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc. | [required] |
**network** | **String** | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\" are test networks. | [required] |
**block_hash** | **String** | Represents the hash of the block, which is its unique identifier. It represents a cryptographic digital fingerprint made by hashing the block header twice through the SHA256 algorithm. | [required] |
**context** | Option<**String**> | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user. |  |

### Return type

## get_block_details_by_block_height_from_callback

> crate::models::GetBlockDetailsByBlockHeightFromCallbackR get_block_details_by_block_height_from_callback(blockchain, network, block_height, context)
Get Block Details By Block Height From Callback

This endpoint creates a shortcut to obtain information from Blockchain data by going through Blockchain Events and a specific Event Subscription. It provides data for the specific Block by providing the `blockHeight` attribute from the Event it takes part in. It applies only for Events related to that user.

### Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Required | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**blockchain** | **String** | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc. | [required] |
**network** | **String** | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\" are test networks. | [required] |
**block_height** | **String** | Represents the number of blocks in the blockchain preceding this specific block. Block numbers have no gaps. A blockchain usually starts with block 0 called the \"Genesis block\". | [required] |
**context** | Option<**String**> | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user. |  |

> crate::models::GetTransactionDetailsByTransactionIdFromCallbackR get_transaction_details_by_transaction_id_from_callback(blockchain, network, transaction_id, context)
Get Transaction Details By Transaction ID From Callback

This endpoint creates a shortcut to obtain information from Blockchain data by going through Blockchain Events and a specific Event Subscription. It provides data for a specific transaction from the Event it takes part in by providing the `transactionId` attribute. It applies only for Events related to that user.
