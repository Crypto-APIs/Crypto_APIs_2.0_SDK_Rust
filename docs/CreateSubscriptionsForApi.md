## mined_transaction

> crate::models::MinedTransactionResponse mined_transaction(blockchain, network, context, mined_transaction_request_body)
Mined transaction

Through this endpoint customers can create callback subscriptions for a specific event. In this case the event is when a specific transaction is mined. By creating this subscription the user will be notified by Crypto APIs 2.0 when that event occurs. The information is returned per specified `transactionId`.    A transaction is mined when it is included in a new block in the blockchain.    {note}To have an operational callback subscription, you need to first verify a domain for the Callback URL. Please see more information on Callbacks [here](https://developers.cryptoapis.io/technical-documentation/general-information/callbacks#callback-url).{/note}    {warning}Crypto APIs will notify the user **only when** the event occurs. There are cases when the specific event doesn't happen at all, or takes a long time to do so. A callback notification **will not** be sent if the event does not or cannot occur, or will take long time to occur.{/warning}

### Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Required | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**blockchain** | **String** | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc. | [required] |
**network** | **String** | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\", \"rinkeby\" are test networks. | [required] |
**context** | Option<**String**> | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user. |  |
**mined_transaction_request_body** | Option<[**MinedTransactionRequestBody**](MinedTransactionRequestBody.md)> |  |  |

### Return type

[**crate::models::MinedTransactionResponse**](MinedTransactionResponse.md)

## new_block

> crate::models::NewBlockResponse new_block(blockchain, network, context, new_block_request_body)
New Block

Through this endpoint customers can create callback subscriptions for a specific event. In this case the event is when a new block is mined in the specific blockchain. By creating this subscription the user will be notified by Crypto APIs 2.0 when that event occurs. The information is returned per specified address.    A new block is mined when it is added to the chain once a consensus is reached by the majority of the miners, which is when the block gets validated and added to the blockchain.    {note}To have an operational callback subscription, you need to first verify a domain for the Callback URL. Please see more information on Callbacks [here](https://developers.cryptoapis.io/technical-documentation/general-information/callbacks#callback-url).{/note}    {warning}Crypto APIs will notify the user **only when** the event occurs.

New confirmed coins transactions and each confirmation

Through this endpoint customers can create callback subscriptions for a specific event. In this case the event is when there are new incoming or outgoing confirmed transactions for coins from/to the customer's address with also a response at each confirmation the transaction has received until the specified confirmations limit is reached.
