## add_tokens_to_existing_from_address

> crate::models::AddTokensToExistingFromAddressR add_tokens_to_existing_from_address(blockchain, network, context, add_tokens_to_existing_from_address_rb)
Add Tokens To Existing fromAddress

Through this endpoint customers can add **Automatic Tokens forwardings** to an already existing `fromAddress`. Unlike the \"Create Automatic Tokens Forwarding\" endpoint, where the `fromAddress` is generated each time, with this endpoint customers can add an automation from another token to one and the same `fromAddress`.    The `fromAddress` can be used as a deposit address. Any funds received by this address will be automatically forwarded to `toAddress` based on what the customer has set for the automation. The  `toAddress` is essentially the main address and destination for the automatic tokens forwarding.    There is also a `minimumTransferAmount` which only when reached will then trigger the forwarding. Through this the customer can save from fees.    Moreover, `feePriority` can be also set,  which defines how quickly to move the tokens once they are received. The higher priority, the larger the fee will be. It can be \"SLOW\", \"STANDARD\" or \"FAST\".    For this automatic forwarding the customer can set a callback subscription.    {warning}Currently we support fungible tokens (ERC-20) **only**, NFTs (ERC-721) are **not** supported.{/warning}    {warning}The subscription will work for all incoming transactions until it is deleted. There is no need to do that for every transaction.{/warning}

### Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Required | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**blockchain** | **String** | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc. | [required] |

**context** | Option<**String**> | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user. |  |
**add_tokens_to_existing_from_address_rb** | Option<[**AddTokensToExistingFromAddressRb**](AddTokensToExistingFromAddressRb.md)> |  |  |

## create_automatic_tokens_forwarding

> crate::models::CreateAutomaticTokensForwardingR create_automatic_tokens_forwarding(blockchain, network, context, create_automatic_tokens_forwarding_rb)
Create Automatic Tokens Forwarding

Through this endpoint customers can set up an automatic forwarding function specifically for tokens (**not** coins). They can have a `toAddress` which is essentially the main address and the destination for the automatic tokens forwarding.     There is also a `minimumTransferAmount` which only when reached will then trigger the forwarding. Through this the customer can save from fees.    Moreover, `feePriority` can be also set,  which defines how quickly to move the tokens once they are received. The higher priority, the larger the fee will be. It can be \"SLOW\", \"STANDARD\" or \"FAST\".    The response of this endpoint contains an attribute `fromAddress` which can be used as a deposit address. Any funds received by this address will be automatically forwarded to `toAddress` based on what the customer has set for the automation.    For this automatic forwarding the customer can set a callback subscription.    {warning}Currently we support fungible tokens (ERC-20) **only**, NFTs (ERC-721) are **not** supported.{/warning}    {warning}The subscription will work for all incoming transactions until it is deleted. There is no need to do that for every transaction.{/warning}    {note}This endpoint generates a new `fromAddress` each time.{/note}

### Parameters

## delete_automatic_tokens_forwarding

> crate::models::DeleteAutomaticTokensForwardingR delete_automatic_tokens_forwarding(blockchain, network, reference_id, context)
Delete Automatic Tokens Forwarding

Through this endpoint customers can delete a forwarding function they have set for **tokens** (**not** coins).    By setting a `fromAddress` and a `toAddress`, and specifying the amount, tokens can be transferred between addresses.     A `feePriority` will be returned which represents the fee priority of the automation whether it is \"SLOW\", \"STANDARD\" OR \"FAST\".    {warning}Currently we support fungible tokens (ERC-20) **only**, NFTs (ERC-721) are **not** supported.{/warning}    {warning}The subscription will work for all incoming transactions until it is deleted.

**reference_id** | **String** | Represents a unique ID used to reference the specific callback subscription. | [required] |
