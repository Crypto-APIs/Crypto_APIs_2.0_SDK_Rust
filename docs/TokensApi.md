## get_contract_details_by_address

> crate::models::GetContractDetailsByAddressR get_contract_details_by_address(blockchain, network, contract_address, context)
Get Contract Details by Address

Though this endpoint customers can obtain information about a smart contract and its details. This can be done by the `address` parameter, i.e. the address of the smart contract.    {note}This address is **not** the same as the smart contract creator address.{/note}

### Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Required | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**blockchain** | **String** | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc. | [required] |[default to ethereum]
**network** | **String** | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\", \"rinkeby\" are test networks. | [required] |
**contract_address** | **String** | Defines the specific address of the contract. | [required] |
**context** | Option<**String**> | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user. |  |

## list_tokens_by_address

> crate::models::ListTokensByAddressR list_tokens_by_address(blockchain, network, address, context, limit, offset)
List Tokens By Address

Through this endpoint customers can obtain token data by providing an attribute - `address`.  The information that can be returned can include the contract address, the token symbol, type and balance.    {note}Please note that listing data from the same type will apply pagination on the results.{/note}

### Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Required | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**blockchain** | **String** | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, etc. | [required] |
**network** | **String** | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"ropsten\", \"rinkeby\" are test networks. | [required] |
**address** | **String** | Represents the public address, which is a compressed and shortened form of a public key. | [required] |
**context** | Option<**String**> | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user. |  |
**limit** | Option<**i32**> | Defines how many items should be returned in the response per page basis. |  |[default to 50]
**offset** | Option<**i32**> | The starting index of the response items, i.e. where the response should start listing the returned items. |  |[default to 0]
