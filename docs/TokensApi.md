## list_tokens_by_address

> crate::models::ListTokensByAddressResponse list_tokens_by_address(blockchain, network, address, context, limit, offset)
List Tokens By Address

Through this endpoint customers can obtain token data by providing an attribute - `address`.  The information that can be returned can include the contract address, the token symbol, type and balance.

### Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Required | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**blockchain** | **String** | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, etc. | [required] |
**network** | **String** | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"ropsten\", \"rinkeby\" are test networks. | [required] |
**address** | **String** | Represents the public address, which is a compressed and shortened form of a public key. | [required] |
**context** | Option<**String**> | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user. |  |
**limit** | Option<**i32**> | Defines how many items should be returned in the response per page basis. |  |[default to 50]
**offset** | Option<**i32**> | The starting index of the response items, i.e. where the response should start listing the returned items. |  |[default to 0]

### Return type

[**crate::models::ListTokensByAddressResponse**](ListTokensByAddressResponse.md)

### Authorization

## list_tokens_transfers_by_address

> crate::models::ListTokensTransfersByAddressResponse list_tokens_transfers_by_address(blockchain, network, address, context, limit, offset)
List Tokens Transfers By Address

Through this endpoint customers can obtain a list with token transfers by the `address` attribute. Token transfers may include information such as addresses of the sender and recipient, token name, token symbol, etc.    {note}This refers only to transfers done for **tokens** not coins.{/note}

## list_tokens_transfers_by_transaction_hash

> crate::models::ListTokensTransfersByTransactionHashResponse list_tokens_transfers_by_transaction_hash(blockchain, network, transaction_hash, context, limit, offset)
List Tokens Transfers By Transaction Hash

Through this endpoint customers can obtain a list with token transfers by the `transactionHash` attribute. Token transfers may include information such as addresses of the sender and recipient, token name, token symbol, etc.    {note}This refers only to transfers done for **tokens** not coins.{/note}

### Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Required | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**blockchain** | **String** | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, etc. | [required] |
**network** | **String** | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"ropsten\", \"rinkeby\" are test networks. | [required] |
**transaction_hash** | **String** | Represents the hash of the transaction, which is its unique identifier. It represents a cryptographic digital fingerprint made by hashing the block header twice through the SHA256 algorithm. | [required] |
**context** | Option<**String**> | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user. |  |
**limit** | Option<**i32**> | Defines how many items should be returned in the response per page basis. |  |[default to 50]
